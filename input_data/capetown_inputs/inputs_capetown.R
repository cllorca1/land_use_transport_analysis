#The trip freq. distribution controls the penalty of longer commutes. In the current setting we have the black line, copied from Munich long time ago. The black
# line reproduces the observed travel time distribution. We found afterwards that the black line can lead to too long commute times in the successive years. If this 
# is observed in SILO-Capetown, it could be a good idea to replace this file by an exponential function, such as the orange line = exp(-0.2 * time_minutes).
#This can be simply done by replacing the column utility of this file accordingly. Has to be checked in the changes in commute distance by year.I selected the -0.2 
# value for Munich with a zero-growth scenario, assuming that commute distance has to remain relatively stable.
